basic ideal is using buckets. 1 bucket for every second because we only need to keep the recent hits info for 300 seconds. hit[] array is wrapped around by mod operation. Each hit bucket is associated with times[] bucket which record current time. If it is not current time, it means it is 300s or 600s... ago and need to reset to 1.
